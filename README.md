# FliperCOVID
This has two type of problems
1.Prediction of the corona virus for two diffrent days
2.TimeSeries problem

COVID_PREDICTION.py contains preprocessing of the given data and the prediction of infection probability on 20/3/2020 int the first part 
and in the second part with the output of the timeseries model we have the 27th DIURESIS prediction(one of the column) with that we will
predict the infection probability on 27/3/2020.
It has two models one is for the probability and other is for predicting DIREUSIS for TEST set.

timeseries.py contains the AUTO ARIMA model for the time series prediction.
